A simple plugin to assist sailors with their race start.

Prior to the start, sail to each end of the start line and “ping” each
end by pressing the port & starboard buttons respectively.

When the 5' gun sounds press the start button. The display will then
display a 5' countdown timer, the boat's speed over ground, and based on
your current speed and heading, distance and time to the start line.
